# Capstone Project Review

## Introduction

This document describes how your Capstone project will be reviewed. Your teachers may also provide additional or alternative information about the Capstone project review process, which you should follow. If you have any questions about this process, please discuss them with your teachers.

## The Project Task

Please see the Capstone task in Learn.co (or shared by your teacher, if applicable).

## The Project Review

You have until the middle of the second Capstone week to create and submit your Minimum Viable Product (MVP), which includes your project repo and presentation. Projects will be reviewed by your teachers by the end of the week.

Teachers will use [this project rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YUC5_QVu8BEd7xBJumzspH40-KuJtL9KQInQYXGi5bE/edit?usp=sharing) to grade your submission and presentation. Each element can receive a rating of "Incomplete", "MVP", or "Complete". You will receive a final 1-5 score based on the rating for each rubric element. A score of 3 or higher is considered passing.

* 1: Less than half of elements are rated "MVP" or "Complete"
* 2: Half or more elements are rated "MVP" or "Complete"
* 3: All elements are rated "MVP" or "Complete"
* 4: All elements are rated "MVP" or "Complete", half or more elements are rated "Complete"
* 5: All elements are rated "Complete"

If your project does not score a 3 or higher on the first review, you will have an option to re-submit your project in the middle of the final week for a second review. Your project must pass this second review for you to graduate with your cohort. 

## Submission Process

Please submit the link to your project repo via the Learn.co assignment tool. Complete the [Capstone MVP Submission Checklist](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-capstone-submission-checklist) before submitting your project to ensure that you don't forget any required elements.

## Summary

This project is a valuable opportunity to create your own portfolio-ready project to showcase your data science skills to employers. Completing this project means that you are ready to succeed in your data science job search. We encourage you to reach out to your teachers if you have any questions. You've got this!
